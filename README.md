# ERP-for-ecommerce-app

Hello there, This Ecommerce system has two-app architecture for an e-commerce system. 
One app for users to browse and shop, and another app for administrators to manage and update the data for the user-facing app.

## User-Facing App (App 1):
- This app is designed for customers and allows them to explore products, add items to their cart, make purchases, and manage their profiles.
- Users can browse product listings, view product details.
- They can create accounts, log in, and manage their personal information, shipping addresses, and payment methods.
- The app communicates with a backend server to retrieve product information, process orders, and handle user data.

## Admin App (App 2):

- This app is intended for administrators and allows them to manage the e-commerce platform's data and settings.
- Admins can add, edit product and category listings, including details like product descriptions, prices, and images.
- They can manage user accounts viewing order histories.
- The app typically includes features for order management, such as tracking order status, processing returns, and managing inventory.
